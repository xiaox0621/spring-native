== How to contribute

This section describes how to contribute native support for libraries or features used in Spring applications.
This can be done either by submitting {github-prs}[submit pull requests] to Spring Native for the scope supported on https://start.spring.io, or by providing native support directly at library or application level otherwise.

[[how-to-contribute-design]]
=== Designing native-friendly Spring libraries

Native support is mostly about making an application and its libraries possible to analyze at build-time to configure what's required or not at runtime.
The goal is to do that in an optimal way to have a minimal footprint.

Spring applications are dynamic, which means they typically use Java language features like reflection in various places.
Spring Native and its Spring AOT build plugins performs AOT transformations, in the context of a specific application classpath and configuration in order to generate the optimal native configuration.
They also generate programmatic versions of `spring.factories` or auto-configurations to reduce the amount of reflection required at runtime.

Each reflection entry (per constructor/method/field) leads to the creation of a proxy class by `native-image`, so from a footprint point of view, these AOT transformations allow a smaller and more optimal configuration to be generated.

The documentation below describes best practices to keep in mind when trying to make Spring code more compatible with native-images.

==== Use `proxyBeanMethods=false` or method parameter injection in `@Configuration` classes

In native applications, `@Bean` annotated methods do not support cross `@Bean` invocations since they require a CGLIB proxy created at runtime.
This is similar to the behavior you get with the so called {spring-framework-docs}/html/core.html#beans-java-basic-concepts[lite mode] or with {spring-framework-api}/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html#proxyBeanMethods--[`@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods=false)`].

It is fine for applications to just use `@Configuration` without setting `proxyBeanMethods=false` and use method parameters to inject bean dependencies, this is handled by Spring Native to not require a CGLIB proxy.

Libraries are encouraged to use `@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods=false)` (most of Spring portfolio currently uses this variant) since it is generally a good idea to avoid CGLIB proxies if not needed and to provide native compatibility.
This behavior could potentially become the default in a future Spring Framework version.

==== Use NativeDetector for native conditional code paths

Spring related code should use `NativeDetector.inNativeImage()` (provided by `spring-core` dependency in the `org.springframework.core` package) to detect native-specific code paths.
Spring Framework or Spring Data takes advantage of this utility method to disable CGLIB proxies since they are not supported in native images for example.

Whenever possible, we recommend writing code that works in both contexts rather than always falling back on the `NativeDetector`.
This way, common code is easier to reason about and test/debug.

==== Do classpath checks in static block/fields and configure build-time initialization

It is possible to configure code in your application/dependencies to run at image build time.
This will speed up the runtime performance of your image and reduce the footprint.

If the behaviour of some code is conditional on some class being present on the classpath, that presence check can be performed when the image is built because the classpath cannot be changed after that.

A presence check is normally done via an attempt to reflectively load a class.
It is optimal if that check can be performed as the native image is built, then no reflective configuration is necessary for that presence check at runtime.
To achieve this optimization:

* Perform the presence check in a static block/field in a type.
* Configure that type containing the check to be initialized at build-time using `@NativeHint`

NOTE: Care must be taken to limit as much as possible the amount of other classes transitively initialized at build-time, since it can introduce serious compatibility issues.

==== Try to favor functional approaches when possible

For code executing at runtime, try to favor functional approaches like lambdas and method references instead of reflection when possible, since these constructs are automatically understood by the native-image static analysis.

For example, if your Spring project is using `RootBeanDefinition`, using the `Supplier` based constructor is native friendly in the sense that the `native-image` compiler understands bean creations without requiring native reflection configuration.
Concretely, instead of `new RootBeanDefinition(BeanFactoryChannelResolver.class)`, use `new RootBeanDefinition(BeanFactoryChannelResolver.class, BeanFactoryChannelResolver::new)`.

NOTE: See {spring-framework-api}/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/RootBeanDefinition.html#RootBeanDefinition-java.lang.Class-java.util.function.Supplier-[the related Javadoc] for more details.

==== Move reflection to build-time when possible

It is fine to use reflection in a native world but it is most optimal to do it in code executed at build-time:

* In the static block/fields of a class initialized at build-time.
* In an AOT transformation run as a Spring AOT build plugin.

NOTE: More guidelines will be provided here as <<spring-aot>> matures.

[[how-to-contribute-design-import-selectors]]
==== Provide hints for import selectors

Spring Native chases down configuration references to other configurations (`@Import` usages).
However if you use an import selector, that means code is deciding what the next imported configuration should be, which is harder to follow.
Spring Native does not do that level of analysis (it could get very complicated).
This means that, although Spring Native can tell it has encountered a selector, it does not know what types that selector needs reflective access to or what further configurations it references.

Spring Native could simply continue, and maybe it would work, maybe it would crash at runtime.
Typically, the error produced when things go wrong due to this missing information is very cryptic.
If the selector is doing a "if this type is around, return this configuration to include", it may be not finding some type (when it is really there but is not exposed in the image) and not including some critical configuration.
For this reason, Spring Native analysis fails early and fast, indicating that it does not know what a particular selector is doing.

To fix it, you should add a hint with the related import selector specified as trigger.
See for example {github-tree}/spring-native-configuration/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/reactive/ReactiveSecurityHints.java[this hint] and the {github-tree}/spring-native-configuration/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.springframework.nativex.type.NativeConfiguration#L104[related service loader entry].

You can temporarily turn this hard error into a warning by setting the `failOnMissingSelectorHint` option to `false` in <<spring-aot-configuration>>.

[[how-to-contribute-new-hints]]
=== Contributing new hints

For most cases Spring Native understands how Spring applications operate - how configurations refer to each other, how beans are going to be instantiated, etc.
However, there are some subtleties that it doesn't understand and to plug those knowledge gaps it relies on hints, these tell the system what extra configuration may be needed for the native image build when particular auto configurations or libraries are active in an application.

A hint may indicate that a specific resource must be included or that reflection on a particular type is required.

When adding support for a new area of Spring or new version of a library, the typical approach to work out the missing hints is as follows:

. Notice an error if your application when you try to build it or run it -- a `classnotfound`, `methodnotfound`, or similar error.
If you are using a piece of Spring we don't have a sample for, this is likely to happen.

. Try to determine which configuration classes give rise to the need for that reflective access to occur.
Usually, we do a few searches for references to the type that is missing, and those searches guide us to the configuration.

. If there is already a `NativeConfiguration` implementation for that configuration, augment it with the extra type info.
If there is not, create one, attach a `@NativeHint` to it to identify the triggering configuration and the classes that need to be exposed, and add it to the `META-INF/services/org.springframework.nativex.extension.NativeConfiguration`.
You may also need to set the accessibility in the annotation (in the `@TypeHint`). It is possible that more dependencies may need to be added to the configuration project to allow the direct class references.
That is OK, so long as you ensure that they are provided scope.

See <<native-hints>> for basic hint documentation. These `@NativeHint` can be hosted in one of two places:

* In the `spring-native-configuration` module, you can see that they are hosted on types that implement the `org.springframework.nativex.extension.NativeConfiguration` interface.
Implementations of this interface should be listed in a `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.springframework.nativex.type.NativeConfiguration` file, which the feature loads through regular Java service loading.
* On Spring configuration classes. That's useful for project-specific hints or while crafting hints on a sample before moving it to the `spring-native-configuration` module (shorter feedback loop).

An `attribute` trigger can be specified on the `@NativeHint` annotation.

* If the hint is on a `NativeConfiguration` class, and no trigger is specified then it is assumed this configuration should *always* apply. This is useful for common configuration necessary for all applications.
* If the hint is on something other than a `NativeConfiguration` class (e.g. on a Spring auto-configuration class) then that type is considered to be the trigger, and if the Spring AOT plugin determines that is 'active', the hint applies.

The `trigger` attribute might be a piece of Spring infrastructure (autoconfiguration, import selector) or just a regular class. If the Spring AOT plugin determines that Spring infrastructure may be active when the application runs, or (for a regular class trigger) that the named class is on the classpath, it will activate the associated hints, informing the native-image build process what is needed.

It is best practice to use the hints in a sample (existing or new one) in order to have automated testing of it.
Once you are happy with the hints you crafted, you can {github-prs}[submit a pull request].

Using the <<tracing-agent>> can also be useful an approximation of the required native configuration without having to run too many native builds.

[[how-to-contribute-dynamic-native-configuration]]
=== Dynamic native configuration

NOTE: For now, providing dynamic native configuration is only supported as part of Spring Native itself since related API are not stable enough. External libraries requiring dynamic configuration can implement a https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/nativeimage/hosted/Feature.html[GraalVM native image feature for now].

Dynamic native configuration needs to be implemented in `spring-aot`. For debugging, you can use either `mvnDebug` or `gradle -Dorg.gradle.debug=true --no-daemon` and connect with a JVM remote debugger on port `8000` for Maven or `5005` for Gradle from your IDE.

==== Implementing `NativeConfiguration`

Sometimes the necessary configuration is hard to statically declare and needs a more dynamic approach.
For example, the interfaces involved in a proxy hint might need something to be checked beyond the simple presence of a class.
In this case the method `computeHints` can be implemented which allows computation of hints in a more dynamic way, which are then combined with those statically declared via annotations.

The `NativeConfiguration` interface contains a couple of default methods that can be implemented for more control.
For example whether the hints on a `NativeConfiguration` should activate may be a more subtle condition that simply whether a configuration is active.
It is possible to implement the `isValid` method in a `NativeConfiguration` implementation and perform a more detailed test, returning false from this method will deactivate the associated hints.

==== Taking more control via processors

Within a Spring application there are going to be a number of active components (the main application, configurations, controllers, etc).
There may be much more sophisticated domain specific analysis to be done for these components in order to compute the necessary configuration for the `native-image` invocation.
It is possible to implement a couple of interfaces to participate in the process the feature is going through:

* `ComponentProcessor` implementations are given the chance to process components and possibly register new configuration.
For example this is used by spring-data (via `SpringDataComponentProcessor`) to do deeper analysis of repositories and the types used in generic signatures to compute reflection/proxy/resource hints.
* `SpringFactoriesProcessor` implementations are given a chance to process the keys and values loaded from `spring.factories` files.
Currently they are allowed to do filtering but this is likely to be expanded in the future.
By filtering it means they may programmatically compute that for some spring.factories key one of the values makes no sense (by analysing classpath contents, for example), and decide to discard meaning no further processing will be performed on it.

[[how-to-contribute-using-container-build-env]]
=== Using container-based build environment

To allow easily reproducible builds of `spring-native`, dedicated interactive Docker images are available for local development (tested on Linux and Mac) and are also used on CI:

- {github-raw}/ci/images/graalvm-ce-image/Dockerfile[`graalvm-ce`]: base image with Ubuntu bionic + GraalVM native, built daily by the CI and available from https://hub.docker.com/r/springci/graalvm-ce/tags[Docker hub]
- {github-raw}/ci/images/spring-native-image/Dockerfile[`spring-native`]: base image with `graalvm-ce` + utilities required to build the project, available from https://hub.docker.com/r/springci/spring-native/tags[Docker hub]
- {github-raw}/docker/Dockerfile.spring-native-dev[`spring-native-dev`]: local image built via `run-dev-container.sh` designed to share the same user between the host and the container.

To use it:

- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Install Docker].
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user[Configure it to allow non-root user] if you are on Linux.
- On Mac, ensure in the Docker preferences resources tab that you give it enough memory, ideally 10G or more, otherwise you may see out of memory issues when building images.
- Run `run-dev-container.sh` to run the Docker container with an interactive shell suitable to run `spring-native` build scripts (see below for more documentation).
- The first time, it will download remotely hosted images built by https://ci.spring.io/teams/spring-native/pipelines/spring-native?group=ci-images[CI].
- The current and the Maven home directories are shared between the host (where is typically the IDE) and the container (where you can run builds).

==== `run-dev-container.sh`

`run-dev-container.sh` runs Spring Native for GraalVM dev container with an interactive shell.

[source]
----
run-dev-container.sh [options]

options:
-h, --help                show brief help
-j, --java=VERSION        specify Java version to use, can be 8 or 11, 11 by default
-g, --graalvm=VERSION     specify GraalVM flavor to use, can be stable or dev, stable by default
-w, --workdir=/foo        specify the working directory, should be an absolute path, current one by default
-p, --pull                force pulling of remote container images
-r, --rebuild             force container image rebuild
----

==== Usual dev workflow

- Import the root project in your IDE.
- Eventually import the sample you are working on as a distinct project in your IDE.
- Run the root project `build.sh` (from the host or the container) if you have made modification to the feature, substitutions or configuration modules.
- Make sure `native-image` is in the `PATH` (usually done by switching to a GraalVM installation with https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMAN]).
- Run `build.sh` of the sample you are working on from the container.

To test the various samples You can also run the root `build.sh` then `build-key-samples.sh` (test only key samples) or `build-samples.sh` (test all samples) from the container.

[[how-to-contribute-scripts]]
=== Scripts

The `native-image` command supports a number of flags for producing information about what is in an image.
However, what can sometimes be really useful is comparing two images.
What is in one that isn't in the other?
Sometimes sifting through the mass of output is tricky.
The scripts folder provides some tools to help with this.

==== Comparing images

First up is `-H:+PrintAOTCompilation` which prints logging information during compilation, looking a bit like this:

----
Compiling FieldPosition[] java.text.DecimalFormat.getNegativeSuffixFieldPositions()  [Direct call from StringBuffer DecimalFormat.subformat(StringBuffer, Format$FieldDelegate, boolean, boolean, int, int, int, int)]
Compiling FieldPosition[] java.text.DecimalFormat.getPositiveSuffixFieldPositions()  [Direct call from StringBuffer DecimalFormat.subformat(StringBuffer, Format$FieldDelegate, boolean, boolean, int, int, int, int)]
----

Thousands and thousands of lines typically.
Typically we turn on that option for `native-image` in the `pom.xml`.
The output is produced to stdout which our samples capture in `target/native/output.txt`.
With two builds done, we can use a script from this folder to produce a tree diff:

----
compilationDiff.sh java8build/target/native/output.txt java11build/target/native/output.txt 8-11.html
----

The inputs are the two collected PrintAOTCompilation outputs to compare and the name for an HTML file that should be generated (this will contain the navigable tree).
Then simply open the HTML file.

image::CompilationDiffTreeView.png[]

One of the key entries to look at in the diff is under the path `com/oracle/svm/reflect` as that shows the entries included due to reflection.
