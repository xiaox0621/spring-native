== Samples

There are numerous samples in the {github-tree}/samples[`samples`] subfolder of the root project.

Maven projects can be built and tested using a local `native-image` installation using the `build.sh` script file present at the root of each sample.
Maven or Gradle projects can be built using Buildpack support using `mvn spring-boot:build-image` or `gradle bootBuildImage` commands which require Docker to be installed.

Beware that native image compilation can take a long time and uses a lot of RAM.

The samples show the wide variety of tech that is working fine: Spring MVC with Tomcat, Spring WebFlux with Netty, Thymeleaf, JPA, and others.
The Petclinic samples brings multiple technologies together in one application.

If you are starting to build your first Spring Boot application, we recommend you follow one of the <<getting-started>> guides.
